# Scarvs Shoe E-commerce App

For us, sneakers have always been more than just shoes. They have  their own culture. Those who know understand the impact sneakers have had on art, music and fashion. Scarves are looking for their sneaker culture. Over time, we aim to advance the history of sneaker and street culture in India. The Scarvs store is not just a retail space. 
It will be a concert hall, an art studio, a chat room, a party space.
